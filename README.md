<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This app models the functions of Google's Keep Notes App. This is an extension of
  a previous version of this task (found in fabihai/3102-midterm) which only implemented
  the notes functionality in the frontend and did not store the notes in a database.
  Here, users can add and delete notes, and have them remain even after refreshing or
  reopening the page due to the values being stored in a database with MongoDB.</li>
</ul>
